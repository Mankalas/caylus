# caylus

Caylus is one of my favorite board games. You're in the XVth century and the King of France asked you to build a castle at Caylus, a city in the south of France. Of course, you'll need resources from the city, and the bigger the city the more abundant the resources. The goal is to gain Prestige, either by building the Castle, or making Caylus prosper, or spend time and resources directly pleasing the King.

This game is amazingly balanced: from all the games I've had with many different people, no strategy appeared to be an always-winning one. Sometimes, if you play well, you can go from last place to first in one or two turns.

Originally, I wanted to create an AI in order to really find out if there really were no "absolute" strategy. But in order to make an AI, I had to implement the game's mecanics. Here I am now: chasing bugs and testing my code in order to have a fully functionning game of Caylus. The game's interface is not very handy yet, and that's a point I'd like to enhance because, for testing purpose, I'd like to record a "real" game, in order to check whether the stats are correct or not. Once I got that, I could let AIs beating each others, organize a competition between the different strategies and find out the "ultimate one".
