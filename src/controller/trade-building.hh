	 * arguments:
	 *   - supply: this is a vector containing the different resources
	 *     the worker must provide in the trade. For the peddler, this set
	 *     only contains deniers,
	 *   - demand: this is a vector containing the different resources
	 *     the owner obtain in the trade. For the peddler, this set
	 *     contains all four basic resources,
	 *   - ratios: this a vector containing pairs of unsigned ints that
	 *     give the ratios of the trade. For the church, it contains
	 *     (2, 3) and (4, 5) as two deniers may be traded against three
	 *     prestige points or four deniers against five pretige points.
