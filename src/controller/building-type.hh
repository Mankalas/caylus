	    please see enum-object.hh for more information.
	    *
	    *  A building can be one of those six types:
	    *   - fixed (drawn on the board),
	    *   - neutral (pink tiles placed at the beginning),
	    *   - made of wood,
	    *   - made of stone,
	    *   - residential (the residences)
	    *   - prestige
	    *
	    * As enum objects, they can be compared and ordered (as each has a
	    * unique id) with usual operators and can therefore be used as key
	    * in maps or hash tables. Their name can be printed with << operator.
